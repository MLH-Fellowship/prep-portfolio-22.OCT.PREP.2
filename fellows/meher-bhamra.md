## About me
Hi! My name is Meher, and I'm a computer science major and general business minor at UMD. I am passionate about technology and its applications in other fields like outer space and archival restoration and would someday like to use what I am learning for those purposes. I am excited for the prep program and can't wait to become more involved and expand my skills in the field!
